Team Shunya represented India at SDC 2018 and the journey was one helluva ride filled with anticipation, hope, perseverance, labour and dedication wrapped in a hot summer breeze. Our logistics had arrived unbearably late at Dezhou with a fast approaching deadline that had us curate the model from scratch in a tight schedule of fourteen days. But then, the teamâ€™s enthusiasm knew no bounds. Shunya House was designed and built within two weeks with insane amount of determination, teamwork and ardour for sustainability in our hearts. The zeal to build a net positive affordable housing system resulted into a beautiful architectural treat to our eyes. Have a look at a preliminary architecture of the house!
